    <p> Hello everyone! My name is Erica, and I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of
        British Columbia. I am currently studying Computer Science, and I created Active as a platform for people to share their hobbies.
        Some of my own hobbies are: singing, playing piano and dancing.
        This summer, I'm working on a project called "fresh". If you're interested in looking into some of my past project,
        check out the link in the navigation bar!

    <p> My project is an app called "fresh", that allows general consumers to purchase groceries at the lowest price possible.
        Fresh is a web-app that allows consumers to make cost-friendly choices for groceries. As a user, I can post grocery prices,
        locations and images and items to the app, at the same time see all the posts that have been submitted to the app.
        Location and items will be stored as strings and prices of items will be stored as numbers.
        Users will be able to compare the prices of groceries they want to purchase.
        Create a shopping list which displays the lowest price found for each item and their location,
        leave thumbs up or down on prices to validate them. </p>
