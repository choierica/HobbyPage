    <p> Hello everyone! My name is Erica, and I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of
        British Columbia. I am looking into co-op opportunities right now, aside from <br> I created Active for fun, and you're welcome to share anything that you'd like to :)

    <p> My project is an app called "fresh", that allows general consumers to purchase groceries at the lowest price possible.
        Fresh is a web-app that allows consumers to make cost-friendly choices for groceries. As a user, I can post grocery prices,
        locations and images and items to the app, at the same time see all the posts that have been submitted to the app.
        Location and items will be stored as strings and prices of items will be stored as numbers.
        Users will be able to compare the prices of groceries they want to purchase.
        Create a shopping list which displays the lowest price found for each item and their location,
        leave thumbs up or down on prices to validate them. </p>
